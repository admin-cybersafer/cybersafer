Welcome to the Cybersafer project.

## About the Project

Cybersafer.ca is a project to help raise awareness around digital security and privacy in Canada. This site is for everyone — tech-savvy or not. 

I've been in the Cybersecurity space for over a decade and currently work at Cloudflare. This site reflects my personal effort to make cybersecurity more accessible, understandable. 

Everything shared on the site is based on my own knowledge, research, and experience. It's not affiliated with my employer and does not represent their views.
