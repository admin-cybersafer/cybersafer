  <h1>Cybersafer.ca</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Cybersafer project.</p>
  <p>This is a community website designed to help Canadians learn about cybersecurity and share practical, trusted information to stay safe online.</p>

  <h2>About the Project</h2>
  <p><strong>Cybersafer.ca</strong> is a project to help raise awareness around digital security and privacy in Canada. This site is for everyone — tech-savvy or not.</p>
  <p>I've been in the Cybersecurity space for over a decade and currently work at Cloudflare. This site reflects my personal effort to make cybersecurity more accessible and understandable.</p>
  <p>Everything shared on the site is based on my own knowledge, research, and experience. It's not affiliated with my employer and does not represent their views.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>To make Canada a safer place online by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharing cybersecurity tips, news, and insights</li>
    <li>Encouraging better digital habits and tools</li>
    <li>Providing resources for individuals, teams, and businesses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contributions</h2>
  <p>This is a personal project for now — but I'm open to collaboration if you're passionate about online safety and have something valuable to share.</p>
